    Shows that when the data within the grid is reloaded but the trackBy value stays the same, the DOM is not
    re-rendered. Thus, any row within the datagrid maintains its state. If the DOM was re-rendered, the modal would not
    open when you clicked the button because the state of the row would be cleared.
