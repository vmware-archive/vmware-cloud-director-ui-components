        Press 'command+.' on Mac OS or 'ctrl+.' on PC to open quick search and search through all the actions. Notice
        that there is a spinner displayed initially for 300ms before displaying the action items. This is because the
        action search provider is created to debounce the search using 2nd argument(boolean) passed to its constructor.
