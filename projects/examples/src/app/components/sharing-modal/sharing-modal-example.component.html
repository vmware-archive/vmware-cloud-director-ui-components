<p>
    This is an example of how to configure the sharing modal on its own. You can customize the title, the tabs, and the
    checkboxes. Opening the modal must be done by a trigger coming outside through the two-way binding of `isOpened`.
    The form value is also a two way binding. Supply the currently shared with entities, and it will emit the new value
    when the user clicks submit.

<button (click)="opened = true">Open</button>
<vcd-sharing-modal
    *ngIf="opened"
    [title]="title"
    [tabs]="tabs"
    [selectAllToggles]="checkboxes"
    [(isOpened)]="opened"
    [formValue]="value"
    (formValueChange)="log($event)"
></vcd-sharing-modal>
