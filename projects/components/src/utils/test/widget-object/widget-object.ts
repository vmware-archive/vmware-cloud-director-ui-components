 * A wrapper around a component in UI code. Each subclass typically lives in the same folder as the

 *   - Access to key HTML elements within it so that tests can assert something about their content
 *   - Abstracting interactions. For example, a login method that takes a username and password and
 *     enters it into both fields and then clicks the submit button. Note that these interactions
 *     cannot contain assertions as those are specific to a testing environment.
 *
 * These widgets can be used in multiple environments by implementing two pieces:
 * - A subclass of WidgetObjectElement<T> where T is the environment's HTMLElement wrapper, such as DebugElement,
 *   Cypress.Chainable or WebElement.
 * - A Widget finder that knows how to instantiate WidgetObjects passing it the correct type of `WidgetObjectElement<T>`
 *   which you have created
 *
 * @example
 *
 * class LoginWidgetObject<T> extends BaseWidgetObject<T> {
 *      private getUserNameInput = this.factory.css('.username');

 *      public getUsernameInput = this.factory.unwrap(this._getUsernameInput);

 *
 *      // Don't need an internal version, use the factory methods to create public methods
 *      public errorMessage = this.factory.dataUi('error-message');
 *
 *       // Sometimes there's no factory for more complex finding logic, write a custom query.
 *      getOkButtonContainer() {
 *          return this.el.getByText('button', 'Ok').parents('.button-container');
 *      }
 *      ...
 *
 *      login(user, password) {
 *          this.getUsernameInput().type(user);

     *   and then hits the submit button; These elements don't provide means to assert anything or even to read
     *   information from the widget objects elements such as their text, CSS class names, etc.
     *
     *   If a test wants to use the native functionality (T), they can call unwrap on the returned WidgetObjectElement.
     *   For example, a Cypress test will call widgetObject.getSomeEl().unwrap().should("be.visible")
